vim Commands:-
(Basics)

:w <- to save file.
:q <- to quit(or exit from the vim).
:wq <- to save and quit.
:x <- save and exit from the vim.
:q! <- quit without saving.
:nu <- displays cursors line number.
:<number>  <- cursor moves to that line number which is mentioned in <number>
           eg:-  :5  <- cursor moves to 5th line number.
                 :20 <- cursor moves to 20th line number.
:set nu to display line numbers.

Working:-
There are three modes of vim:-
1) Normal Mode.
2) Insert Mode.
3) Visual Mode

1) Normal Mode.
This mode is default meaning, when you open a file(vim file.java), initially
vim is in normal mode.

In normal mode you can not type into the file.

In normal mode you are only allowed to give commands to vim.
(Commands of vim are listed above)

Following is the scenarios only applicable when you are in the normal mode:-

a) To copy single line:-
   hit: "yy", then move cursor position where you want to paste and then hit: "p"
b) To copy multiple lines:-
   hit: "<number>y + arrow key(up arrow or down arrow)"
   eg:-
       1) let's say you want to copy above 3 lines from your current cursor. 
       hit: 3y and then up arrow key. Move your cursor where you wanted to paste and then hit: "p"
       2) let's say you want to copy 3 lines below from your current cursor. 
       hit: 3y and then down arrow key. Move your cursor where you wanted to paste and then hit: "p"
c) Deletion is similar to copy. I'll leave it for you to try it out.

2) Insert Mode:-
This mode is where you can write into file.

Following are the ways to get into insert mode:-
a) i <- insert mode activated from the current cursor position.
b) a <- append cursor to next coloumn and then insert mode is activated.

Note:-
If you are in the insert mode then to go back to command mode hit "escape button"
Note: Insert mode can be entered only from Normal mode and not from visual mode.

Now,
To keep it simple I won't talk much about visual mode, allthough I will give little bit glimpse about it.
So,
3) Visual mode:-
Note: Visual mode can be entered only from Normal mode and not from insert mode.
There are various ways to enter into visual mode:-
1) hit: "v"
2) hit: shift + "v"
3) hit: ctrl + "v"
(I will not give the explaniation of this you try it because it is self explainatory.).
To exit from the visual mode hit "escape button"(after exit, vim will enter into normal mode).
eg:-
//file contents
Hello What's up
//suppose i want to copy "What's" word and placed into next line.
//so, hit: "escape button" to make sure you are in normal mode.
// now move cursor to "W" and hit: "v"
// then select What's word which will be highlighted and then hit: "y"
// go to insert mode for next line---hit: "escape button"----hit: "p".
// Now, file will look like
Hello What's up
What's

// Deletion is same as above. I'll leave it for you to check it out.

following is the overall example:-
$ vim hello.java

<hit "i" to enter into insert mode and type following>
class Hello {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}

<hit "escape button" to enter into command mode and then hit ":w" to save file>
<now hit ":q" to exit from the vim>

$

There are number of ways to exit from vim:-
First of all enter into command mode.
1) :wq
2) :w and then :q
3) :x

** Note that this is very short tutorial on vim. Actually, theres a lot going on inside the vim, various options.
   This will be enough for the current coding. **

Happy Coding!
